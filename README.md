# Clustering-algorithms
The process of running the codes are pretty straight forward.
I have commented clearly which part is running the algorithm, and which part is the evaluation score, as well as the code for plotting. 
From top to bottom, it is importing the libraries -> reading the dataset -> standardize the dataset, extracting the attributes values and the ground truth to evaluate -> K-Means, DBSCAN, Spectral -> ARI score -> Plotting
